      School's out and summer is in full swing — which means it's officially vacation season! But while getaways are exciting, they don't always go off without a hitch. Travel can bring on motion sickness symptoms, and overindulging in new foods may lead to nausea. Whether you're jet-setting abroad or taking a scenic drive to the beach, it helps to be prepared with travel-friendly solutions on hand for queasiness and discomfort.

        <h3>Face Forward</h3>
        <p>Looking forward — literally — can help ease motion sickness. Facing the direction you're traveling allows your eyes and inner ear to sync up, which can reduce feelings of dizziness or nausea. Try focusing on a fixed point in the distance, like the horizon, to minimize conflicting visual cues and calm your senses.</p>

      <div class="remedy-item">
        <h3>Air it Out</h3>
        <p>Let in some air to keep queasiness at bay. Fresh air can work wonders for motion sickness, so crack a window or step outside when you can. If that's not an option, aim an air vent at your face or pack a portable fan to help cool down and reset your senses.</p>

        <h3>Try This Homeopathic Helper</h3>
        <p>Find motion sickness relief wherever you go with Boiron's MotionCalm On the Go. Powered by plant-based and other pure active ingredients, this homeopathic motion sickness medicine prevents and relieves nausea, vomiting and dizziness associated with travel, amusement rides, or video games.* The pellets melt in your mouth, allowing you to act fast against symptoms.

        <h3>Practice Mindful Eating</h3>
        <p>Vacations are a time to indulge, but trying new foods or eating too much too quickly can lead to nausea. To help your stomach stay settled, try to eat slowly and savor each bite. Smaller, more frequent meals throughout the day can also be easier to digest than large, heavy ones.</p>

      <div class="remedy-item">
        <h3>Take a Time Out</h3>
        <p>Vacation days are often packed with exciting plans, but jumping into activity too soon after eating can trigger nausea. Try setting aside time after meals to rest and digest whether it's by reading a book or simply chatting with your fellow travelers.</p>

        <h3>What to Pack for Relief</h3>
        <p>Tuck NauseaCalm On the Go into your travel bag for multi-symptom upset stomach relief wherever your adventures take you. This homeopathic nausea medicine is powered by plant-based and other pure active ingredients to ease nausea and vomiting.* The meltaway pellets dissolve in your mouth without the need for food or water — ideal for portable relief from stomach flu, fullness, and more.</p>
